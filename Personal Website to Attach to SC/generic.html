								<p>Formerly A Redneck Texan Combat Soldier</p>
								<h2>To A Silicon Valley Sapper Coder</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Retiring from the Army Feb 28th of 2018, I had a plan, my last few years in the service were rough, but I was set up to become a overseas contractor
								and then head to law school.  Both of these prospects seemed respectable, but boring, and I was not looking forward to walking around in the desert
								getting shot at occassionally.  I wanted adventure and action, but also friends, fun, brotherhood and women.  The military had been my whole life
								starting military school at 13, then joining the army right after graduation, I knew nothing else.
							</p>

							<p>The last possible thing I could ever think of doing was coming out to Silicon Valley to start a Software Company, then a Coding Boot Camp,
								and then transition into being a contractor for the military.  So when my best friend John approached me with the idea, that is exactly what happened.
								We both dropped everything, I let law school and being a overseas contractor go to the wayside and said, "Lets do this".
							</p>

							<p>I have always had a very strong belief that the path that is rarely traveled is the one that I must take.  It is the hardest, most people do not know it
								many people think you are crazy for taking it, but it sure provides one hell of a adventure.  What's more adventerous, difficult, stressful and fun then
								coming across the United States, to a place not meant for veterans in a entirely foreign environment and setting up a company?  I sure can't think of anything
								but that's why I am here, and in time I know I will find more and more people like me around as well.  The strivers, the risk-takers and ones who go all-in,
								those are my people, and if I can't find them here, I will bring them here myself, one veteran at a time.
							</p>

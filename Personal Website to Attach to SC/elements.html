								<p>From a Silicon Valley Coder</p>
								<h2>To A Software Development Teacher
								</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Currently, at Sapper Coding we are focused on providing software products and services that live up to the standard of what America expects
								 of its Veterans.  We are connecting with industry leaders to line veterans up with jobs after graduation, learning which types of jobs are most in demand,
								and networking to establish our brand name and promote awareness.  We are developing our learning platform for our veterans using real-world knowledge,
								with experience that we have gained ourselves first-hand and have soley survived by doing this.
							</p>

							<p>The next phase will begin with launching the live platform to a roster of veteran students that we have recruited who understand the program
								and the benefits it provides. Each veteran student will only expend 4 month of their 36 month GI Bill and then will make $3759 a month for the E5
								with dependents rate.  Therefore, each student will become a full-fledged software developer in 16 weeks, and will earn over $15k in housing allowance
								just for attending the school.  In addition to training students up on a 16 week platform, we will ensure they have a established personal website with
								a portfolio of real world work with each one of our students, and set them up with companies to offer them jobs as they graduate.
							</p>

							<p>Military Contracting is the final evolutionary stage that will be taken.  By moving into the world of military contracting we will now be 
								utilizing veterans we have trained to complete federal and state software development projects.  At this point we will be training veterans
								to become software developers and then immediately hiring them to perform on large-scale projects to help the state and federal government.
							</p>
